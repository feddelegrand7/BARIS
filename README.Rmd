With **BARIS** you can exploit the [French Official Open Data Portal](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/) API directly from R. The package offers several capabilities, from listing the available data sets to extracting the needed resources. Nevertheless, there are many features offered by the API (e.g. uploading a data set, removing a resource ... among others) that are not covered within the **BARIS** package which instead focus on the data extraction aspect of the API. The good news is that the user doesn't need an API key or any credential to run the available functions provided by **BARIS**. Finally, in order to fully apprehend the package, a distinction has to be made. The data.gouv API provides several **data sets which contain one or many data frames.** The unique identifier (ID) of a data set has this form : **53699934a3a729239d2051a1** while the ID of an individual data frame or resource has this form: **59ea7bba-f38a-4d75-b85f-2d1955050e53**. 

## Installation

You can install the BARIS package from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

install.packages("BARIS")

```


You can also install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:


```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

devtools::install_github("feddelegrand7/BARIS")

```

## BARIS_home()

Using the function `BARIS_home()` you can list the displayed datasets within the [home page of the data.gouv website](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/). The function doesn't take any argument. It will return a data frame with many useful information about the data set.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(BARIS)

BARIS_home()

```
The data is quite condensed so you should use the `View()` or `DT::datatable()` functions.


## BARIS_search()

The `BARIS_search()` function allows you to search for a specific data set. Suppose we're curious about the city of Marseille. 


```{r}

BARIS_search(query = "Marseille", n_pages = 20)

```

The **n_page** argument is used to specify the number of pages to search for according to the pagination system of the API, by default its value is equal to 20. Now, in order to choose a dataset, let's have a look at two columns, the ID and the title of each dataset. 

```{r}

Marseille_data <- BARIS_search(query = "Marseille", n_pages = 20)

Marseille_data[, c("id", "title")]


```

Suppose we're interested in the dataset entitled **Marseille - Monuments historiques** with its corresponding ID:
**5cebfa8306e3e77ffdb31ef5** and we want to know more about this data. In this case, the `BARIS_explain()` function can be useful. 


## BARIS_explain()

`BARIS_explain()` returns a description of a dataset. It has one argument which is the ID of the dataset of interest. 

```{r}

BARIS_explain("5cebfa8306e3e77ffdb31ef5")

```

The description is in French but even non-French speakers can use this function in conjunction with a translation tool, for the example the [googleLanguageR package]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=googleLanguageR). 


## BARIS_resources()

As mentioned previously, each data set contains one or several data frames or as the API call them **resources**. The `BARIS_resources()` function allows you to list all the available resources within a determined data set. 


```{r}

BARIS_resources("5cebfa8306e3e77ffdb31ef5") # The "Marseille - Monuments historiques" ID


```


Many useful information related to the resource are provided: The id, the title, the format, the date of publication, the url of the resource, and a description.


## BARIS_extract()

The `BARIS_extract()` function allows you to extract the needed resource into your R session. You have to specify the id of the resource and its format. Currently, "only" theses formats are supported: json, csv, xls, xlsx, xml, geojson and shp, nevertheless you can always rely on the url of the resource to download whatever you need. 

As an example, let us extract the above listed csv file: *MARSEILLE_MONUMENTS_HISTORIQUES_2018.csv*:


```{r}

BARIS_extract(resourceId = "59ea7bba-f38a-4d75-b85f-2d1955050e53", format = "csv")

```


# BARIS Addin
